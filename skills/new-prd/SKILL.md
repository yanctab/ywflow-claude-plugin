# New PRD

Capture a feature idea as a PRD and file it as a GitHub issue.
Synthesise from the current conversation and the codebase — do NOT
interview the developer. No code changes.

## Process

### File-mode (with `.md` file argument)

When invoked with a path to a `.md` file (e.g., `/new-prd ./prd.md`):

1. **Read the file:** Use the Read tool to load the entire file content.

2. **Validate required sections:** Check that the file contains all seven required section headings (case-sensitive, must be exact):
   - `## Problem Statement`
   - `## Solution`
   - `## User Stories`
   - `## Implementation Decisions`
   - `## Testing Decisions`
   - `## Out of Scope`
   - `## Further Notes`
   
   If any section is missing:
   - List the missing sections to the user
   - Halt without filing the issue
   
   If all sections are present, proceed to step 3.

3. **Extract the H1 title:** Search the file for the first line matching the pattern `# <title>` (a single hash followed by a space and text).
   - If found, extract the title text (the part after `# `)
   - If not found, report "Error: no H1 heading found in file" and halt without filing
   
4. **File the issue:** Execute the command:
   ```
   gh issue create --title "PRD: <extracted-title>" --body-file <absolute-path-to-file> --assignee @me
   ```
   Use the absolute path to the file. Capture the command output.

5. **Report result:** Print the returned issue URL from the command output. The output from `gh issue create` will contain a line like `https://github.com/...`. Extract and print only this URL.

### Synthesis-mode (no argument)

When invoked with no argument or when file-mode validation fails:

1. **Infer the feature title:** If no explicit title was provided as an
   argument, use the current conversation context to infer a clear,
   concise feature title.

2. **Invoke prd-researcher (first pass):** Call the `prd-researcher`
   agent with the feature title, passing the current conversation
   context. The agent returns a module sketch.

3. **Ask confirmation questions:** Relay the sketch to the developer
   and ask, in one turn:
   - Do these modules match your expectations?
   - Which modules do you want tests written for?

4. **Invoke prd-researcher (second pass):** Call the `prd-researcher`
   agent again with:
   - The feature title
   - The module sketch
   - The developer's answers to the two questions
   
   The agent writes the full PRD and files the GitHub issue, returning
   the issue URL.

5. **Report result:** Print the returned issue URL.

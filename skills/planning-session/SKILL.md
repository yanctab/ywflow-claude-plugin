# Planning Session

Ask questions one at a time — never batch multiple questions in a single turn.

Before each question, scan the codebase using Read, Glob, and Grep to gather
relevant context. If a question can be answered from codebase evidence alone,
answer it yourself and move on without asking the user.

Each question must be accompanied by a recommended answer. State your
recommended answer clearly so the user can accept it or correct it.

# Planning Session

Ask questions one at a time — never batch multiple questions in a single turn.

Before each question, scan the codebase using Read, Glob, and Grep to gather
relevant context. If a question can be answered from codebase evidence alone,
answer it yourself and move on without asking the user.

Each question must be accompanied by a recommended answer. State your
recommended answer clearly so the user can accept it or correct it.

## Dependency-Ordered Decision Tree

Follow this dependency-ordered decision tree — foundational decisions
(problem, user, scope) always come first, because architecture, testing,
and rollout decisions depend on them.

### Phase 1 — Foundational (problem, user, scope)

Ask about the core problem, who the user is, and what is in scope
before any other questions. These answers are prerequisites for all
later phases.

### Phase 2 — Architecture

Ask how the feature will be implemented and what dependencies or
integrations are involved. These decisions depend on scope and user
from Phase 1.

### Phase 3 — Testing

Ask how the feature will be tested and what critical scenarios must
be covered. These decisions depend on the architecture from Phase 2.

### Phase 4 — Rollout

Ask how the feature will be rolled out and documented. These decisions
depend on all earlier phases.

## Exit Criteria

The exit criteria are: all decision-tree branches resolved with no open
questions remaining. When every phase (foundational, architecture, testing,
rollout) is complete and the user has confirmed their answers, declare
that you are entering wrap-up before assembling the PRD.
